This project is mainly an attempt to build a GUI using the MVC pattern.
A customer analytics tool that categorizes customers of a product as they are added to the system. There are 2 alternative analytics tools, one stores only the number of customers in each group, while the other stores the candidate object in a set.
Customers can be grouped by age:
- Senior if (s)he is 60 or more years old,
- Adult if between 30 and 59
- Young if between 18 and 29.
Or by gender: Female or Male. (To do: add a non-binary option.)
